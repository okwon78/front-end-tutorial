        <em>YouTube</em> represents one of the largest scale and most sophisticated industrial recommendation systems in existence. In
        this paper, we describe the system at a high level and focus on the dramatic performance improvements brought by
        <b>deep learning</b>. The paper is split according to the classic
        two-stage information retrieval dichotomy: first, we detail a
        deep candidate generation model and then describe a separate <strong>deep ranking model.</strong> We also provide practical lessons
        and insights derived from designing, iterating and maintaining a massive recommendation system with enormous userfacing impact.
